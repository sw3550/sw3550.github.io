              <p>I used ChatGPT to help me reflect on my experience attending a conference, and ChatGPT provided me with a framework that I used to guide my reflections. Here's how I evaluated myself on each item and what I learned from my experience:</p>
<p>Pre-Conference Preparation: I reflected on the amount of preparation I did before attending the conference.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Did I review the schedule of events and plan which sessions to attend?<br>
Score: 60/100. I checked the schedule and found so many interesting sessions that I added them all to my calendar. However, this led to overlapping sessions and made the conference feel overwhelming. In the future, I plan to follow one or two major scholars and focus on one topic to make the conference more manageable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did I read any relevant papers or research articles that were going to be presented?<br>
Score: 0/100. I didn't read any relevant papers or research articles, which made some sessions less engaging for me. Next time, I plan to prepare more in this area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did I practice my networking skills and prepare my elevator pitch?<br>
Score: 40/100. I purchased a digital business card, but I didn't prepare an elevator pitch. While I had some great discussions, I missed opportunities to discuss my research and projects. Next time, I plan to be more prepared to talk about my work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did I finish all assignments before heading to the conference?<br>
Score: N/A. This item was not prompted by ChatGPT, but I realized the importance of checking assignment deadlines beforehand. I missed some deadlines and received a zero on some assignments, which caused me a lot of stress during the conference.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Conference Atmosphere: I reflected on the overall atmosphere of the conference.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Was it welcoming and inclusive?<br>
Score: N/A. ChatGPT didn't prompt me on this item, but I noticed that the conference could have been more inclusive from my perspective. For example, it was hard for me to find the roundtable numbers when I first entered the venue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Were there opportunities to connect with other attendees and build relationships?<br>
Score: 100/100. I had several opportunities to connect with other attendees and build relationships, such as the business meeting of the informal learning environment research SIG and the reception from The Educational University of Hong Kong. I even got to visit a behavioral science museum affiliated with the University of Chicago and made some new connections there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did the conference offer a variety of sessions and workshops that were relevant to my research interests?<br>
Score: 100/100. I attended several paper sessions, roundtables, and business meetings, which were all great opportunities for young people to make connections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Presentation Skills: I reflected on my presentation skills and how I presented my research to others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did I effectively communicate my research in a clear and concise manner?<br>
Score: N/A. ChatGPT didn't prompt me on this item, but I didn't have a presentation at this conference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Networking Opportunities: I reflected on the networking opportunities provided at the conference.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Did I meet other researchers in my field and build connections with them?<br>
Score: 80/100. I connected with several researchers in my field during the business meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did I attend any networking events or social gatherings that allowed me to interact with other attendees on a personal level?<br>
Score: 80/100. I attended several networking events and social gatherings, such as business meetings and receptions, which allowed me to interact with other attendees on a personal level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning Outcomes: I reflected on the learning outcomes of the conference.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did I gain new knowledge and insights into my research area?<br>
Score: 100/100. Although I only attended a few presentations, I gained new insights and knowledge related to methodology and my research area. Methods, framework, and data source are three major things I can learn from others' papers.</li>
</ul>
