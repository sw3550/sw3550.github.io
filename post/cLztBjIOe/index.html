            <div class="post-date">06/01/2023</div>
            
            <div class="post-content" v-pre>
              <p>I really appreciate that Dr. Dennen mentioned the overwhelming amount of information on social media platforms like Twitter. It is something that I have experienced in my own life, and it can make me feel uncomfortable. Returning to the metaphor of a fire hydrant, searching for useful information on the internet can feel like trying to take a sip of water from a fire hydrant. The sea of information can become unstoppable once you open the valve.</p>
<p>Now, let's dive into today's topic: the FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) effect. Originally used in finance, this term typically refers to hedge funds fearing that they might miss out on an investment opportunity with great potential. This fear drives them to invest in all the programs they encounter, often resulting in poor investment decisions. However, in the context of social media, FOMO refers to the phenomenon where people fear missing out on updates from their friends, leading them to spend a significant amount of time surfing social media platforms. In this blog post, we will explore the impact of FOMO on our academic pursuits and discuss strategies to navigate social media while staying focused on our goals.</p>
<h1 id="the-fomo-effect-and-academic-pursuits">The FOMO Effect and Academic Pursuits</h1>
<p>Social media platforms offer a seemingly endless stream of information, updates, and discussions. While this can be advantageous for our academic goals, it can also lead to the FOMO effect. As we scroll through our feeds, we come across colleagues presenting groundbreaking research, attending conferences, or receiving accolades for their achievements. We may feel a sense of urgency or pressure to keep up, fearing that we might miss out on valuable opportunities or fall behind in our academic journey.</p>
<h1 id="managing-fomo-and-prioritizing">Managing FOMO and Prioritizing</h1>
<p>While it is natural to feel a sense of excitement or even envy when witnessing the accomplishments of others on social media, it is crucial to manage these emotions effectively. Here are some strategies that I have been practicing to help navigate the FOMO effect while staying focused on academic goals.</p>
<h2 id="define-your-objectives">Define Your Objectives</h2>
<p>Take the time to clearly define your academic objectives. Understand what you wish to achieve and the steps required to reach your goals. This clarity will enable you to filter the information on social media and focus on content that aligns with your aspirations. I feel anxious before when I saw peers or students in my age got some awesome achievements, and I relaized that this is not healthy for myslef. Life is not a competition, and I really shouldn't be anxious about others acomplishments. What I should do is focusing on my goal.</p>
<h2 id="curate-your-feed">Curate Your Feed</h2>
<p>Be intentional about curating your social media feed by following accounts, groups, and communities that are directly related to your academic interests. Surrounding yourself with relevant and meaningful content will reduce the chances of being overwhelmed by irrelevant updates. This is one piece of advice that I believe Dr. Dennen would give me, especially considering my tendency to be curious about everything, including methodologies, new trends, and various topics. Just learning new terminology alone could easily burn me out. Therefore, I am currently focusing on a few specific topics that I am genuinely more interested in than others.</p>
<h2 id="set-boundaries">Set Boundaries</h2>
<p>As we mentioned &quot;context collapse&quot;, establishing boundaries for social media usage matters in the management of FOMO. Determine specific times of the day when you will engage with social platforms and allocate dedicated time for focused academic work. By creating a balance, you can avoid getting caught up in an endless cycle of scrolling and comparing yourself to others.</p>
<h2 id="embrace-the-power-of-jomo">Embrace the Power of JOMO</h2>
<p>Counter the FOMO effect by embracing the Joy of Missing Out (JOMO) (Fuller, 2018). Understand that it is impossible to be present everywhere and involved in everything. Instead of focusing on what you might be missing, appreciate the opportunities and experiences you are currently engaged in.</p>
<h2 id="foster-real-connections">Foster Real Connections</h2>
<p>While social media offers valuable networking opportunities, do not overlook the importance of fostering real-life connections. Engage in face-to-face conversations, attend conferences, and actively participate in academic communities within your institution or field. Building authentic relationships can provide support, inspiration, and a sense of belonging beyond the digital realm.</p>
