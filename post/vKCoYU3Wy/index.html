              <p>This journal explores the concept of blurring the boundaries between online and real life, emphasizing that the virtual realm is also an integral part of reality. The title of this journal may not directly refer to &quot;virtual reality&quot; but rather focuses on the significance of online life.</p>
<p>As an individual, I have observed various facts in my own life, and as a researcher, I have been following several academic studies in this field. The increasing evidence indicates that being online, or maintaining an online presence, has become an optimal choice for scholars as it has become an inseparable part of real life.</p>
<p>In the context of our course, EME6414: Web 2.0 and Learning Technology, social media emerges as a significant new technology. Its pervasive presence and impact on individuals' perception of reality hold tremendous importance. Within this blog, I aim to provide insights from the perspective of a PhD student, shedding light on this statement and delving into the implications of social media and online presence in academia and beyond.</p>
<p>Virtual is reality because our data is stored in seemingly stable online servers, making it an integral part of our lives. Our digital presence, including personal information, memories, and interactions, exists in the virtual realm. The reliance on online platforms for communication, information sharing, and content creation has solidified the virtual world as an extension of our reality. However, this interconnectedness also brings its challenges. A prime example is when one of my social media accounts was unexpectedly banned without any clear reason. This incident highlighted the impact of virtual experiences on our real lives and the potential consequences of losing access to our virtual identities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, virtual is reality because some of our most significant connections are formed and maintained online. As a PhD student, I observe that academic research and collaboration take place in the virtual realm. We rely on online platforms to access and read other researchers' articles, connecting with experts in our fields from around the globe. Following their social media accounts provides us with a means to stay connected, receive timely updates, and engage in scholarly discussions. These virtual connections often become an integral part of our professional network, shaping our research endeavors and academic growth.</p>
<p>Moreover, virtual is reality because we are not mere passive recipients of virtual influences; instead, we actively learn from the virtual realm. The internet and social media platforms offer a vast repository of information and knowledge accessible at our fingertips. We engage with online courses, tutorials, and educational content that expand our understanding and skills. Additionally, virtual communities and online forums provide platforms for learning, where individuals share their expertise and experiences, fostering a collective growth of knowledge. We actively participate in discussions, exchange ideas, and seek guidance, contributing to our personal and intellectual development.</p>
<p>The other day, I encountered a review article related to Twitter economy of higher education encompassing diverse function of social media towards academia (something like online academia just came in my mind), and I would like to share this article with you:</p>
