              <h1 id="reading-notes-for-networked-the-new-social-operating-system">Reading notes for <em>Networked: The New Social Operating System</em></h1>
<p>I learned about the concept of a social support system from a counselor, but it was during a conversation with a PhD student specializing in social work that I gained a deeper understanding. However, in the context of the book I'm referring to, &quot;Networked: The New Social Operating System,&quot; the term &quot;network&quot; carries a broader connotation.</p>
<p>In Part 2 of the book, titled &quot;How Networked Individualism Works,&quot; the authors explore how different aspects of our lives are interconnected. They discuss how relationships become networked, families function as networks, work is networked, and even creators and information become part of the network. For this journal, I have chosen to focus on the topic of information.</p>
<p>As Rainie and Wellman (2012) point out, information has taken on a special nature since it became computerized. While we are familiar with the presence of hypertext links supporting Web 2.0, we are also witnessing the rapid growth of generative AI. This technology has the ability to generate various forms of content, such as images, code, and much more. The question arises: Is the information generated by AI also networked?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, because AI utilizes algorithms to compute the probability of the next word, creating a networked system. The connections between different pieces of information are established through the algorithms' ability to analyze patterns, make predictions, and generate coherent content. In this sense, the information generated by AI becomes part of the larger network, contributing to the collective pool of knowledge and data.</p>
<p>It is fascinating to observe how information, once solely human-generated, now intertwines with the power of artificial intelligence and networked systems. As technology continues to advance, the concept of networked information will likely expand, bringing new possibilities and challenges. Exploring these developments can provide us with valuable insights into the evolving nature of our interconnected world.</p>
