              <p>In this week's reading and discussion, we have seen Web 2.0 as a decentralized system that encourages produsage and networked knowledge. However, it also causes the problem of reliability.</p>
<p>Assessing expertise could be an application or transfer learning of media literacy. In my first week's post, I have shared a few games designed to develop learners' media literacy. In this blog, I would like to share more challenges I found on this issue.</p>
<p>Even though Web 2.0 (or social media) brings us tons of information, challenges come along with the explosive growth of information. Whether we are an audience, consumer, or prosumer (whatever we choose to call ourselves), we face more difficulties when trying to assess the reliability of the information we see online.</p>
<p>Firstly, we are experiencing unprecedented information overload. With the rise of Web 2.0, there is an overwhelming amount of information available online. This abundance can make it challenging to discern which sources are trustworthy and which ones lack credibility.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the information we receive, there is a huge amount of misinformation and fake news. False or misleading information can be easily spread and shared across social media platforms, making it difficult for users to differentiate between accurate and false content. Rapid information dissemination has exacerbated the situation. Information spreads rapidly on the internet, often without proper fact-checking or verification. In this fast-paced environment, misinformation can quickly go viral, making it difficult for users to distinguish between accurate and unreliable information.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have noticed three interesting concepts (usually used in communication): filter bubbles (Pariser, 2011), echo chambers (Cinelli et al., 2021), and confirmation bias (Klayman, 1995; Knobloch-Westerwick et al., 2015). Online platforms tend to personalize content based on users' preferences, creating filter bubbles and echo chambers. This means individuals are often exposed to information that aligns with their existing beliefs, limiting their exposure to diverse perspectives and potentially reinforcing biased or inaccurate information. Confirmation bias, on the other hand, leads people to seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs and biases. This confirmation bias can hinder the objective evaluation of expertise and lead to a reliance on sources that reinforce preconceived notions.</p>
<p>Lastly, the lack of source evaluation skills is a critical issue for most social media users. Many internet users lack the necessary skills to critically evaluate online sources. Assessing the credibility of an author, understanding the biases present in a piece of content, and recognizing signs of misinformation are skills that need to be developed through media literacy education.</p>
