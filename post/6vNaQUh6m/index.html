              <p>This week I read an article about teenagers' experiences about personalization in social media and found it related to our topic. So I shared my reading summary here.</p>
<p>The article is a qualitative study that utilizes focus groups to explore the experiences of adolescents with personalization on social media platforms. The study examines the levels of awareness and understanding of personalization among adolescents, as well as their emotions and attitudes towards it. The findings suggest that while many adolescents are familiar with personalized content, their understanding of the underlying mechanisms may be limited. The study also highlights the mixed emotions participants have towards personalization, appreciating the interesting content but expressing concerns about increased usage, overly personal advertisements, and a sense of being watched.</p>
<p>Two research questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are adolescents’’ experiences with personalization on social media?</li>
<li>Which emotions do they have toward personalized platforms and content?</li>
</ol>
<p>The conceptual framework of the article:<br>
<img src="https://sw3550.github.io/post-images/1687095599444.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
Social media literacy derives from specific skills about the platforms’ unique affordances that in time are integrated and generalized into broader knowledge.<br>
Skills are learned through participation – interacting with the platforms, other users, and peers.<br>
Awareness of personalization must make up the first step toward literacy related to these specific social media mechanisms.<br>
Social media literacy centers on adolescents’ shared experiences with personalization as a general social media phenomenon.<br>
Phenomenology aims to explore and understand the lived experiences of individuals and how they make sense of their world.</p>
<p>In regard to their participants, of the 48 participants, 21 were male, and 27 were female students. The participants were recruited from two lower secondary schools and three upper secondary schools in an urban area in south-eastern Norway.</p>
<p>The method is suited for the conceptual framewok for three reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Exploration of shared experiences: The conceptual framework emphasizes that social media literacy centers on adolescents' shared experiences with personalization as a general social media phenomenon. Focus group interviews are well-suited for exploring shared experiences and allowing participants to discuss and reflect on their experiences in a group setting. This method allows for the exploration of common themes, perspectives, and insights related to social media literacy and personalization.</li>
<li>Interaction and participation: The conceptual framework highlights that skills related to social media literacy are learned through participation and interaction with the platforms, other users, and peers. Focus group interviews provide a platform for participants to actively engage with each other, share their experiences, and build upon each other's insights. The interactive nature of focus groups allows for the exploration of the dynamics and interactions that contribute to social media literacy.</li>
<li>In-depth understanding: The goals of the study include gaining an in-depth understanding of participants' experiences, attitudes, and emotions towards personalization on social media platforms. Focus group interviews provide an opportunity for participants to express their thoughts and feelings in a group setting, allowing for a rich and nuanced exploration of their experiences. The method allows for probing, follow-up questions, and group discussions that can lead to deeper insights and understanding.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even though this article is about phenomenon of personalization of social media, I would like to collect artifacts about adolescents’ experience with social media, which could triangulate the data, and provide more detailed examples to teenagers’ experience towards personalization of social media.</p>
