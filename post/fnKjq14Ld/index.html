              <p>I followed an uploader, similar to a YouTuber in China, on Bilibili.com. This uploader happens to be a senior researcher at Adobe, and he shares insights on academic and industry-related topics in the United States. Additionally, he has collaborated with fellow researchers to create a podcast.</p>
<p>The other day, while logging into my Mastodon account, I was surprised to find his presence on my page, thanks to the algorithm's recommendation. It reminded me that the world, especially the virtual world, can be remarkably small. However, despite the vastness of the online realm, I couldn't help but sense a feeling of a weak tie between us. (Alternatively, is this a kind of context collapse?)</p>
<p>The concept of weak ties theory, developed by Mark Granovetter in his 1973 work &quot;The Strength of Weak Ties,&quot; comes to mind. Granovetter argued that while strong ties, characterized by close relationships with friends and family, provide crucial emotional support, weak ties—relationships that are more distant or casual—are highly valuable in terms of providing access to new information and opportunities.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this, I ponder the philosophy of social media, learning, communication, and networks. Technology serves as a tool, and it follows that social media functions as a tool as well. However, what about network, communication, and learning? In my opinion, communication and networking are also tools because they are not ends in themselves. They serve as means to facilitate the desired outcomes. On the other hand, learning, in some cases, can be seen as a result in and of itself, as it encompasses the process of acquiring knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>Considering these aspects, it becomes evident that social media platforms, communication channels, and networks are interconnected tools that can shape our experiences, interactions, and access to information. Understanding their role as tools within the broader framework of learning and communication helps us navigate the virtual landscape more consciously and effectively. By recognizing the value of weak ties, we can appreciate the potential for new connections, information, and opportunities that emerge from our interactions in the virtual world.</p>
