              <p>In today's digital age, personal learning networks (PLNs) have become a valuable resource for individuals seeking knowledge and skills in their areas of interest. As I delved deeper into PLNs and explored their significance, I realized just how instrumental they can be in our learning journeys. In this blog post, I will share my experiences and reflections on the role of PLNs and the profound impact social media has had on my academic and everyday life.</p>
<h1 id="exploring-plns">Exploring PLNs</h1>
<p>The concept of PLNs revolves around informal and online methods of acquiring knowledge. According to a video I came across, PLNs are centered around the learning objective of acquiring new knowledge and skills. In essence, they encompass a diverse network of interconnected individuals, institutions, and resources. PLNs offer immense potential for ongoing professional development, mentoring, and crowdsourcing, which makes them an invaluable tool for individuals seeking growth and learning.</p>
<h1 id="harnessing-the-power-of-social-media">Harnessing the Power of Social Media</h1>
<p>When I think about crowdsourcing and building PLNs, social media platforms like Web 2.0 immediately come to mind. These platforms have emerged as powerful tools that facilitate the creation and expansion of PLNs. Personally, I have found social media to be an indispensable resource for building my own PLNs. Platforms such as group chats, mailing lists, Google Groups, Facebook Groups, WeChat, and Slack have provided me with avenues to engage with like-minded individuals, experts, and scholars. I actively engage in group chats and communities on mailing lists for people interested in large language models in education and museum education (not sure if this counts as &quot;social media&quot; now), Google Groups (NYC-Based STEM Maker educators), Facebook Groups (AERA division), WeChat (several Chinese-based education PhD student groups), and Slack (some scholars interested in learning analytics). Through these platforms, I have actively participated in discussions and communities focused on topics such as large language models in education and museum education. It's fascinating to witness the transformative potential of social media in fostering connections and enabling knowledge-sharing.</p>
<h1 id="my-approach-to-plns">My Approach to PLNs</h1>
<p>In addition to participating in various group chats and communities, I have also adopted my own methods for seeking information. One of my go-to tools, Feedly, recommended by Dr. Dennen during a class session, has become a bedtime app for me. It allows me to stay up-to-date with the latest publications in the field of educational technology. To further streamline my learning process, I have created customized boards within Feedly to categorize different topics, theories, and methods mentioned in articles. This personalized approach to organizing information has significantly enhanced my learning experience and made it more efficient.</p>
<h1 id="social-medias-impact-on-everyday-life">Social Media's Impact on Everyday Life</h1>
<p>Beyond the realm of academia, social media has had a profound influence on my everyday life. Being an international student in the U.S., I have encountered numerous situations where social media has become an indispensable tool for acquiring life skills. From negotiating car prices to modifying bathtub water pressure, installing car monitors, and even fixing plumbing issues, I have successfully tackled various household tasks with the help of online tutorials and videos on platforms like YouTube. Notably, a Chinese social media platform called Xiao Hong Shu (Little Red Book) has been instrumental in providing practical solutions and tips shared by fellow Chinese students. It has become my go-to platform, akin to a combination of Instagram, Reddit, and Pinterest, serving as a life guide or handbook in unfamiliar territories.</p>
<h1 id="reflections-on-the-role-of-social-media-and-plns">Reflections on the Role of Social Media and PLNs</h1>
<p>While social media has undoubtedly played a significant role in my learning and everyday life, I cannot deny the sense of mismatch it occasionally brings. The reliance on social media as a primary source of information and guidance does raise concerns. However, when used mindfully, social media can be an invaluable resource that bridges knowledge gaps, connects individuals, and empowers personal growth.</p>
<p>Personal learning networks and social media have transformed the way we learn and acquire skills. By tapping into the power of PLNs and leveraging the vast resources available through social media platforms, we can foster ongoing learning, professional development, and personal growth. However, it is essential to approach social media with caution.</p>
