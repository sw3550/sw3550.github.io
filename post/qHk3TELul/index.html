              <p>I was immersed in a social media platform for more than 2 hours, and I feel so guilty about it. I'm reflecting on what I watched during that time.</p>
<p>During my social media session, I went through various content in my archive. Here's a breakdown of what I encountered:</p>
<p>Beijing Opera video feeds: I watched several songs, with each video averaging around 10 minutes. This content evoked a positive feeling, but I acknowledge that spending excessive time on it could become overwhelming and tiring.</p>
<p>Academia-related posts: I came across content related to conferences, papers, and anecdotes shared by others in the academic community. This content had both positive and negative effects on me. On one hand, it provided valuable information related to my academic life. On the other hand, I found myself comparing myself unfavorably to others, which triggered feelings of inadequacy, envy, or self-doubt. I recognize that this tendency to compare oneself to the idealized versions of others' lives portrayed on social media can lead to guilt.</p>
<p>Random cute cats and dogs: I couldn't resist watching videos or looking at pictures of these adorable animals. It's hard not to enjoy their cuteness!</p>
<p>Recipes: I spent some time learning new dessert recipes. While this activity was relatively brief, it added a positive aspect to my social media experience as I expanded my culinary knowledge.</p>
<p>MBTI feeds: They are just like horoscope, as they provide a means for individuals to explore and understand their self-identity.</p>
<p>Just share your fav social media contents under this post.</p>
