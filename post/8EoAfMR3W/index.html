              <p>As the class progresses, I feel that Web 2.0-based Learning and Performance are becoming vague to me. What is Web 2.0-based learning? In this blog, I will use my own experience and try to define Web 2.0-based learning.</p>
<p>Learning is defined as &quot;an increase, through experience, of problem-solving ability&quot; (Washburne, 1936). What can people learn from Web 2.0 platforms? In what ways can people learn from social media?</p>
<ul>
<li>Information can be both the content that people learn and the way in which they learn from it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Web 2.0 platforms provide access to a vast amount of information on a wide range of topics. Users can search for specific information, explore curated content, or follow trusted sources to stay updated and informed.</p>
<p>Online courses, tutorials, and other educational resources can also be found on Web 2.0 platforms. These platforms often feature interactive elements, multimedia content, and assessments to facilitate structured learning.</p>
<p>In addition to structured learning, Web 2.0 platforms heavily rely on user-generated content, which can be a valuable source of learning. Users can create and share content such as blog posts, videos, podcasts, and presentations, allowing others to benefit from their knowledge and perspectives.</p>
<p>Serendipity plays a role in learning through social media, as users may come across unexpected and valuable learning opportunities while engaging with content and interacting with others.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Web 2.0 platforms often leverage algorithms and user data to provide personalized learning recommendations. Users receive tailored content suggestions based on their interests, previous interactions, and learning preferences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, information can be the subject of people's learning on Web 2.0 platforms, as well as the ways in which they acquire knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Web 2.0 platforms foster social learning by connecting individuals with shared interests and goals. Users can join communities, groups, or forums to engage in discussions, ask questions, share insights, and learn from the experiences and expertise of others. Users can work together on projects, contribute to wikis or shared documents, and provide feedback to facilitate collective learning experiences.</p>
<p>Moreover, Web 2.0 platforms enable individuals to reflect on their learning journeys and receive feedback from peers, mentors, or experts. Blogs, discussion boards, and comment sections facilitate reflective practices and constructive dialogue.</p>
<p>Overall, Web 2.0 platforms offer diverse opportunities for learning, combining access to information, user-generated content, social interaction, personalization, and reflective practices.</p>
