<p>When it comes to social media, its relevance to my major, instructional design and learning systems, becomes evident. The question arises: can social media be considered a learning system? Numerous research studies and frameworks have supported this notion, as demonstrated by the works of Manca and Ranieri (2016A; 2016B). Lately, I have developed a keen interest in understanding how individuals learn online<br>
within affinity spaces. Lave and Wenger (1991) highlighted the potential for learning in a community, while Gee (2005) took this concept even further by suggesting that one does not necessarily need to be a formal &quot;member&quot; of a community to learn. Instead, by actively engaging in a particular space, individuals can acquire knowledge from the existing resources and interactions within that space, simply through observation. Social media platforms offer a wealth of information and opportunities for individuals who have access to them. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the persistent barriers that impede many others who have limited or no access to these social media platforms. These barriers, which restrict access to social media platforms, significantly impact individuals who are unable to engage in the online learning opportunities and resources they provide. Limited access to social media can stem from various factors such as socioeconomic disparities, geographical location, technological limitations, or cultural constraints. Such barriers hinder individuals from benefiting from the vast information and knowledge-sharing potential that social media platforms offer.</p>
<h1 id="entry-2-field-notes-twitter-etiqutte">Entry 2 Field notes (Twitter Etiqutte)</h1>
<p>After I started my PhD, my colleagues discussed the importance of having an &quot;online presence&quot; and an academic profile. Online presence typically includes a Google Scholar profile, Twitter, and a personal website. For those in computer science or related programming majors, it may also involve a GitHub page. Some other scholars find academia and ResearchGate to be useful tools for building their academic network.</p>
<p>Until recently, Twitter was the largest and most influential social media platform among academics. However, due to recent concerns related to Elon Musk's activities, it is now facing criticism. Nevertheless, I will explain how to set up your academic Twitter account (as well as other social media platforms).</p>
<ul>
<li>Username: It's important to use your real name on Twitter in the context of academia. I did so. Then you can introduce your Twitter to others at the conference.</li>
<li>Profile photo: Some posts suggest that your profile photo should be recognizable, ideally a headshot without sunglasses (Sarah, 2020). However, I am not entirely comfortable with that. I chose to use my real name on Twitter but opted for a less identifiable photo.</li>
<li>Write a compelling bio: Your bio matters. It's better to have a brief introduction than none at all, and a well-designed one is even more effective. I personally use emojis to add some personality to my bio.</li>
<li>Personal rules: One blogger mentioned the importance of setting &quot;personal rules&quot; for your social media account (Sarah, 2020), but I didn't follow this advice. However, I would like to share her example here:
<ol>
<li>Mostly post about #scicomm, #meded, and #WomenInSTEM.</li>
<li>Follow individuals in STEM and medical fields.</li>
<li>Maintain a professional tone and minimize personal posts.</li>
<li>Limit discussions on politics.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Build your academic network (as we discussed in class): Now it's time to follow your peers on Twitter and invite them to follow you back. After a few months, you might have established a robust online academic network!</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="entry-3-useful-resources-for-developing-media-literacy">Entry 3 Useful resources for developing media literacy</h1>
<p>As we discussed on Canvas, we expressed concerns regarding fake news and the importance of developing media literacy among our audience. Here are a few resources that you might find useful in fostering students' media literacy, which include games and websites.</p>
<h2 id="games">Games</h2>
<ul>
<li>A five-minute game that helps protect you against Covid-19 misinformation: https://www.goviralgame.com/books/go-viral/</li>
<li>A quick game that helps you develop basic social media literacy: https://harmonysquare.game/en/play</li>
<li>A game introduces fake news: https://www.getbadnews.com/en#intro</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="websites">Websites</h2>
<ul>
<li>One I really like: commonsense https://www.commonsense.org/education/lists/media-literacy-games-tools-and-lessons</li>
<li>PBS education: https://florida.pbslearningmedia.org/</li>
