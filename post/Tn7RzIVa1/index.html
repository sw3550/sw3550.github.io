              <p>Audience feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interaction types<br>
There are diverse types of interactions, including simple likes and deeper engagements, such as comments.</li>
<li>Likes: From my perspective, the act of liking can have two meanings.<br>
Positive reaction: One meaning of &quot;like&quot; is to express a positive reaction or appreciation for a piece of content. When someone likes a post or a comment, it typically indicates that they enjoyed or agree with the content and want to show their support.<br>
Bookmarking or saving. Another meaning of &quot;like&quot; can be interpreted as bookmarking or saving the content for future reference. In some social media platforms, users have the option to like a post as a way to easily revisit it later or to signify their interest in the topic discussed.</li>
<li>Comments: Comments refer to the feedback or responses provided by the audience. Comments are considered a form of deeper engagement interaction from the perspective that they involve a more active and involved response from the audience. Unlike a simple like, which is a quick and passive form of interaction, comments require the audience member to take the time to write a response or provide feedback. By leaving a comment, the audience member can express their thoughts, ask questions, offer insights, or engage in a conversation related to the content. Comments often indicate a higher level of interest and involvement with the content compared to a mere like. Therefore, comments are generally seen as a deeper and more meaningful form of engagement in audience feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different social media<br>
I tend to use social media platforms that facilitate strong connections, such as Instagram, WeChat, and Twitter. Alternatively, I could say that I have managed to create a social media presence within a close-knit network.</li>
<li>Broader audience group (tag)<br>
After Brett mentioned the use of tags, I realized that I should have considered using tags in my knowledge sharing activities. I could employ tags to expand the reach of my audience on Twitter.</li>
<li>Knowledge sharing is an activity that combats the increasing entropy of information.<br>
As I have mentioned in previous blogs, entropy refers to the measure of randomness or disorder in a system. In the context of information, entropy can be seen as the increasing amount of unorganized, fragmented, or unreliable data that exists. With the rapid advancement of technology and the vast amount of information available today, it's easy for knowledge to become scattered, inconsistent, or lost in the sea of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowledge sharing, on the other hand, is the deliberate act of exchanging and disseminating knowledge among individuals or communities. It involves conveying information, ideas, experiences, and expertise to others in a structured and organized manner. By sharing knowledge, individuals contribute to the creation of a more coherent and meaningful understanding of a subject matter.</p>
<p>In my opinion, writing a knowledge sharing post not only benefits your audience but also benefits yourself. After finishing the museum recommendation, I noticed that I had gained a clearer understanding of what I had written.</p>
